# Rugby Game Score Keeper

Hello! I am currently trying to review older skills I learned back at Prime using react and Javascript. I am currently working on this project on the side to practice these skills and get back into casual coding. After getting a full-time job, I have less time to work on personal projects like this, but I will attempt to make small regular changes. So far I am using an old to do list as a template, but I will adjust it when I have full CRUD functionality. I need to fix update and then I can add the major components outside of the template.
